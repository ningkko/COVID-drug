This repo contains the official code and analyses results for the paper [Using Twitter Data to Understand Public Perceptions of Approved versus Off-label Use for COVID-19-related Medications](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocac114/6625661), published on JAMIA, 2022. We release the following resources:
- the NLP pipeline for analyzing public perception of drug use in this repository
- A RoBERTa-based drug stance detection model, `drug-stance-bert`, in an off-the-shell fashion, available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ningkko/drug-stance-bert). 

If you use our pipeline or models, please kindly cite our work with

## NLP Pipeline

### 1. Preprocessing
We have all preprocessing steps summarized in [its own README](./preprocessing/README.md). Follow the instructions.

### 2. Time trend analysis
Time trend analysis is in the time_trend folder. Follow `Processor.ipynb` to generate data for plotting the trends, and then use the `plot_trend.py` file to plot.

### 3. Stance detection
To train the stance models, follow the trainer, to run inference on tweets, follow `inference.ipynb`.

### 4. Geoinference
Use `processor.ipynb` to process the data we got from stance detection, unify user locations and calculate statewide average stance. Use the `state_map.Rmd` to visualize the results.

### 5. Content analysis
Follow `clustering.ipynb` to cluster and visualize tweets. Use `NER.ipynb` to find NERs and visualize the results in word clouds.

### 6. Demographic analysis
Follow the README.md file inside `demographic_analysis` to replicate the demographic and political orientation inference and analysis.
